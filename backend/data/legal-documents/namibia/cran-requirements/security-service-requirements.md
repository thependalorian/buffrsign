# CRAN Security Service Requirements: Digital Signature Platform Compliance

## Overview and Regulatory Context

The Communications Regulatory Authority of Namibia (CRAN) establishes comprehensive security service requirements for digital signature platforms and electronic communication services operating in Namibia. These requirements are designed to ensure the security, reliability, and integrity of digital signature services while protecting users and maintaining trust in the digital ecosystem. Compliance with CRAN security service requirements is mandatory for all digital signature service providers operating in Namibia, including the BuffrSign platform.

CRAN security service requirements are based on international best practices and standards, including ISO 27001 for information security management, ISO 14533 for digital signature procedures, and other relevant international standards. These requirements establish a comprehensive security framework that addresses technical, operational, and organizational security aspects of digital signature services. The requirements are designed to be technology-neutral while ensuring that all digital signature services meet appropriate security standards regardless of the specific technologies used.

## Technical Security Requirements

### Cryptographic Standards and Algorithms

CRAN requires digital signature platforms to implement strong cryptographic standards and algorithms that provide appropriate levels of security for the services offered. The minimum cryptographic requirements include the use of SHA-256 or stronger hash functions for document hashing, RSA with 2048-bit keys or ECC with 256-bit keys for asymmetric cryptography, and secure random number generation for key creation. These requirements ensure that digital signatures provide the necessary level of security and protection against cryptographic attacks.

The cryptographic implementation must also include proper key management procedures that ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of cryptographic keys. This includes secure key generation using hardware security modules (HSMs) or other secure key generation devices, secure storage of private keys, and proper key backup and recovery procedures. The system must also implement key rotation, revocation, and disposal procedures to manage the lifecycle of cryptographic keys effectively.

### Authentication and Access Control

Digital signature platforms must implement robust authentication and access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access the system and create digital signatures. CRAN requires multi-factor authentication for all user access, including something the user knows (password), something the user has (token or smart card), and something the user is (biometric). This multi-layered approach ensures that unauthorized access is prevented even if one authentication factor is compromised.

Access control must be implemented using role-based access control (RBAC) principles, where users are assigned specific roles and permissions based on their responsibilities and requirements. The system must also implement session management procedures that ensure secure user sessions and automatic session termination after periods of inactivity. Access control must also include procedures for managing user accounts, including account creation, modification, and deletion.

### Network and Infrastructure Security

Digital signature platforms must implement comprehensive network and infrastructure security measures to protect against external threats and ensure the availability of services. CRAN requires the implementation of network segmentation, firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and secure network protocols. The infrastructure must also be protected against physical threats through appropriate physical security measures.

Network security must include the use of secure communication protocols such as TLS 1.3 for all data transmission, implementation of virtual private networks (VPNs) for remote access, and regular network security assessments. The infrastructure must also be designed with redundancy and failover capabilities to ensure high availability and business continuity in the event of system failures or security incidents.

## Operational Security Requirements

### Security Monitoring and Incident Response

CRAN requires digital signature platforms to implement comprehensive security monitoring and incident response procedures. This includes real-time monitoring of system activities, automated detection of security threats, and immediate response to security incidents. The monitoring system must be able to detect various types of security threats, including unauthorized access attempts, suspicious activities, and potential security breaches.

Incident response procedures must be well-defined and tested regularly to ensure effective response to security incidents. This includes procedures for incident detection, analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery. The system must also include procedures for communicating with stakeholders, regulatory authorities, and law enforcement agencies in the event of security incidents.

### Audit Trail and Logging

Digital signature platforms must maintain comprehensive audit trails and logging of all system activities. CRAN requires detailed logging of all signature operations, including the identity of signers, the time of signing, the documents signed, and the signature validation results. This information must be stored securely and maintained for the required retention period to support legal and regulatory requirements.

Audit trails must be tamper-proof and include mechanisms to detect any unauthorized modifications to log files. The system must also implement automated log analysis and alerting to identify suspicious activities and potential security threats. Audit trails must be regularly reviewed and analyzed to ensure compliance with security requirements and to identify areas for improvement.

### Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery

CRAN requires digital signature platforms to implement comprehensive business continuity and disaster recovery procedures to ensure the availability of services in the event of system failures or disasters. This includes implementing redundant systems, backup procedures, and recovery procedures that can restore services quickly and effectively.

Business continuity procedures must include regular testing of backup and recovery procedures to ensure their effectiveness. The system must also implement procedures for maintaining service availability during planned maintenance and system updates. Disaster recovery procedures must be designed to minimize downtime and ensure that critical services can be restored within acceptable timeframes.

## Organizational Security Requirements

### Security Policies and Procedures

CRAN requires digital signature platforms to establish comprehensive security policies and procedures that govern all aspects of security operations. These policies must be documented, regularly reviewed, and updated to reflect changes in technology, threats, and regulatory requirements. Security policies must cover all aspects of security operations, including technical security, operational security, and organizational security.

Security procedures must be implemented to ensure that security policies are effectively enforced. This includes procedures for user access management, system administration, security monitoring, and incident response. All personnel must be trained on security policies and procedures to ensure their effective implementation.

### Personnel Security and Training

CRAN requires digital signature platforms to implement personnel security measures to ensure that only trustworthy individuals have access to sensitive systems and information. This includes background checks for all personnel, security clearances for personnel with access to sensitive information, and ongoing monitoring of personnel activities.

Security training must be provided to all personnel on a regular basis to ensure that they understand security requirements and procedures. Training must cover various aspects of security, including technical security, operational security, and organizational security. Personnel must also be trained on their responsibilities for maintaining security and reporting security incidents.

### Vendor and Third-Party Security

CRAN requires digital signature platforms to implement security measures for vendors and third-party service providers. This includes conducting security assessments of vendors and third-party service providers, establishing security requirements for vendor relationships, and monitoring vendor compliance with security requirements.

Vendor security requirements must be clearly defined and communicated to all vendors and third-party service providers. The system must also implement procedures for monitoring vendor activities and ensuring that vendors comply with security requirements. Vendor relationships must be regularly reviewed and updated to ensure ongoing compliance with security requirements.

## Compliance and Certification Requirements
