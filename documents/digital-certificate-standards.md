# CRAN Digital Certificate Standards: Digital Signature Platform Compliance

## Overview and Regulatory Context

The Communications Regulatory Authority of Namibia (CRAN) establishes comprehensive digital certificate standards for digital signature platforms and electronic communication services operating in Namibia. These standards are designed to ensure the security, reliability, and interoperability of digital certificates while providing the necessary foundation for trusted digital signature operations. Compliance with CRAN digital certificate standards is mandatory for all digital signature service providers operating in Namibia, including the BuffrSign platform.

CRAN digital certificate standards are based on international best practices and standards, including ISO 27001 for information security management, ISO 14533 for digital signature procedures, X.509 certificate standards, and other relevant international standards. These standards establish a comprehensive certificate framework that addresses technical, operational, and organizational aspects of digital certificate management. The standards are designed to ensure that all digital certificates meet appropriate security and reliability requirements regardless of the specific technologies used.

## Technical Certificate Standards

### Cryptographic Standards and Algorithms

CRAN requires digital signature platforms to implement strong cryptographic standards and algorithms for digital certificate operations. The minimum cryptographic requirements include the use of SHA-256 or stronger hash functions for certificate hashing, RSA with 2048-bit keys or ECC with 256-bit keys for asymmetric cryptography, and secure random number generation for key creation. These requirements ensure that digital certificates provide the necessary level of security and protection against cryptographic attacks.

The cryptographic implementation must also include proper key management procedures that ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of cryptographic keys used in certificate operations. This includes secure key generation using hardware security modules (HSMs) or other secure key generation devices, secure storage of private keys, and proper key backup and recovery procedures. The system must also implement key rotation, revocation, and disposal procedures to manage the lifecycle of cryptographic keys effectively.

### Certificate Format and Structure

Digital signature platforms must implement digital certificates that comply with established certificate format and structure standards. CRAN requires compliance with X.509 certificate standards, which define the structure and format of digital certificates used in public key infrastructure (PKI) systems. These standards ensure that digital certificates are interoperable and can be validated by different systems and applications.

Certificate format requirements include proper certificate structure with all required fields, appropriate certificate extensions, and correct encoding of certificate data. The system must also implement procedures for validating certificate format and structure to ensure that all certificates meet the required standards. Certificate format validation must include checks for proper certificate structure, valid certificate extensions, and correct encoding of certificate data.

### Certificate Validation and Verification

Digital signature platforms must implement robust certificate validation and verification procedures that ensure the authenticity and reliability of digital certificates. CRAN requires the implementation of comprehensive certificate validation procedures that include certificate chain validation, certificate status verification, and certificate policy compliance checks. These validation procedures must be performed in real-time to ensure the immediate detection of invalid or compromised certificates.

Certificate validation must include checks for certificate chain validation, which verifies that certificates are issued by trusted certificate authorities and that the certificate chain is complete and valid. The system must also implement certificate status verification procedures that check whether certificates have been revoked or suspended. Certificate policy compliance checks must verify that certificates comply with applicable certificate policies and requirements.

## Operational Certificate Standards

### Certificate Lifecycle Management

CRAN requires digital signature platforms to implement comprehensive certificate lifecycle management procedures that ensure the proper creation, issuance, management, and disposal of digital certificates. This includes establishing procedures for certificate enrollment, certificate issuance, certificate renewal, certificate revocation, and certificate disposal. The certificate lifecycle management system must be designed to handle all aspects of certificate operations efficiently while maintaining security and compliance requirements.

Certificate lifecycle management must include procedures for certificate enrollment, which involves the process of requesting and obtaining digital certificates. The system must implement secure enrollment procedures that verify the identity of certificate applicants and ensure that only authorized individuals receive certificates. Certificate issuance procedures must ensure that certificates are issued securely and that all required certificate information is properly included.

### Certificate Authority Operations

Digital signature platforms must implement robust certificate authority (CA) operations that ensure the secure and reliable issuance of digital certificates. CRAN requires the establishment of secure CA operations that include proper CA infrastructure, secure CA procedures, and comprehensive CA security measures. The CA operations must be designed to ensure the integrity and reliability of the certificate issuance process.

CA operations must include secure CA infrastructure that protects CA systems and operations from unauthorized access and compromise. This includes implementing secure CA facilities, secure CA systems, and secure CA procedures. The CA must also implement comprehensive security measures that protect CA operations from various types of threats and attacks.

### Certificate Revocation and Status Checking

Digital signature platforms must implement comprehensive certificate revocation and status checking procedures that ensure the timely detection and handling of compromised or invalid certificates. CRAN requires the implementation of certificate revocation procedures that can quickly invalidate compromised certificates and certificate status checking procedures that can verify the current status of certificates.

Certificate revocation procedures must include mechanisms for quickly revoking compromised certificates and for notifying users and systems about revoked certificates. The system must implement certificate revocation lists (CRLs) and Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) services that provide real-time certificate status information. Certificate status checking procedures must ensure that certificate status information is accurate, up-to-date, and readily available.

## Organizational Certificate Standards

### Certificate Policies and Practices

CRAN requires digital signature platforms to establish comprehensive certificate policies and practices that govern all aspects of certificate operations. These policies must be documented, regularly reviewed, and updated to reflect changes in technology, threats, and regulatory requirements. Certificate policies must cover all aspects of certificate operations, including technical requirements, operational procedures, and organizational responsibilities.

Certificate practices must be implemented to ensure that certificate policies are effectively enforced. This includes procedures for certificate enrollment, issuance, management, and revocation, as well as procedures for certificate validation and verification. All personnel must be trained on certificate policies and practices to ensure their effective implementation.

### Personnel Training and Certification

CRAN requires digital signature platforms to provide comprehensive training and certification programs to ensure that personnel understand and comply with certificate standards. This includes providing training on certificate policies and practices, establishing certification programs, and conducting regular training sessions. Organizations must ensure their training and certification programs meet all applicable requirements.

Certificate training must cover various aspects of certificate operations, including technical requirements, operational procedures, and organizational responsibilities. Personnel must also be trained on their responsibilities for maintaining certificate security and for responding to certificate-related incidents. Training must be provided on a regular basis to ensure that personnel remain current with certificate standards and procedures.

### Third-Party Certificate Management

CRAN requires digital signature platforms to implement certificate management procedures for third-party certificate authorities and service providers. This includes conducting certificate assessments of third-party certificate authorities, establishing certificate requirements for vendor relationships, and monitoring vendor compliance with certificate standards. The system must also implement procedures for ensuring that third-party certificates are integrated with the platform's certificate system.

Third-party certificate management must include procedures for assessing the certificate capabilities of third-party certificate authorities and for establishing appropriate certificate requirements for vendor relationships. The system must also implement procedures for monitoring third-party certificate compliance and for ensuring that third-party certificates are secure and reliable.

## Compliance and Certification Requirements
